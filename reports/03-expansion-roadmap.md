## Expansion Decision Framework
```
Should we enter zone Z?
├── Net Revenue/Trip > 3 EGP? → Continue
├── LTV:CAC > 2.5 in similar demographics? → Continue
├── Can we achieve 70% utilization within 90 days? → Continue
├── Dead miles < 4km achievable with hub strategy? → Continue
└── All yes → APPROVE expansion
```
